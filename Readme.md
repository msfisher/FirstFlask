# First Flask Project
## Purpose: To test out deploying an application to the cloud so this simple project was created for that purpose
## Date: November 2024
## Author: Fisher

This project is using the Flask endpoints for the user to pass in some text and the program responds with the word frequency distribution

So if you were to visit the endpoint "about" and pass in the following text:
127.0.0.1:5000/about/This text is sample text 

then the application will tell you how many occurrences of each word appears in the text passed

To Do
1) make the application secure by checking the input passed to the user
2) add feature to show which sentences are more important based on the word frequency distribution
3) add feature that user can enter the text into a text box versus using the end point
4) add feature to display the frequency distribution using a graph
5) add a test suite to deploy with the project
